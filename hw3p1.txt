1a) What are the variables of this CSP?
The variables of the CSP are the 81 cells that can hold values.

b) What are their domains?
Each cell can take the domain {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, or the possible values for a given Sudoku cell

c) How would you translate the requirement that no two of the same digit may occur in the same row, column, or block into binary constraints?

We could translate this requirement into a set of 810 different binary comparisons of sets of 2 cells. We know that a given cell can interact with 20 possible different cells to determine if it satisfies these constraints (8 for row, 8 for columns, and 4 for the block that it is a part of which are not part of the row or column). With 81 different cells, this yields 810 binary comparisons.

d) Do you need to explicitly constrain each digit to occur at least once in the row, col and block? Why or why not?

No. Although this is in fact a constraint of the sudoku board, our binary implementation implicitly accounts for this. We say that a cell cannot be the same as the the eight other cells in its row, the eight in its column, or the eight in its box (minus the 4 overlaps). In effect, this is saying that the digits must be unique, and given that there are 9 spaces for the digits 1-9, it implicitly means that each digit must occur once in each row, block, and column.
